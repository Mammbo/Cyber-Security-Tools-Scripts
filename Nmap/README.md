# Nmap Automation, GUI, database compatiablity, and csv convertor for reports
HUGE thanks to gh0x0st and their repoistory pythonizing_nmap which helped me a ton and is what the automated_scan.py file is using, the rest of the code like the xml to csv parser, database compatiable, email notifications, and the nmap gui was created by me.
